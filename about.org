I actually hate making blogs, I love tinkering, but I'm a failure at documenting every discoveries I've found so far. When I heard about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] and how it's basically built-in inside /Emacs/ with [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]], maybe it's the time to really start using it.

The blog itself is completely build from /org-mode/, managed with several /Emacs-lisp/ functions, scripted using /GNU [[file:Makefile][Makefiles]]/. The /Emacs lisp/ build file [[file:publish.el][publish.el]] is independent and can be run using vanilla /Emacs/ with no configuration.
