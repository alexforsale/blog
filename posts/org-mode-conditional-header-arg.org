* Literate Programming                                  :org:mode:codeblocks:
  Two classical operations in literate programming[fn:1]:
  - Tangle :: Extract the source code blocks and generate real working code files for further compilation or execution, eventually outside of Emacs.
  - Weave :: Export the whole Org file as literate, human-readable documentation (generally in HTML or LaTeX).
  Furthermore, we can conditionally instruct which code blocks to evaluate by using /emacs lisp/ in the code block /header arguments/.
** Example
   #+name: freebsd
   #+begin_example
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :exports (if (string= "freebsd" (downcase (substring (shell-command-to-string "uname -s") 0 -1))) "both" "none") :results verbatim
     (print "this will only evaluated on freebsd")
   #+end_src
   #+end_example
